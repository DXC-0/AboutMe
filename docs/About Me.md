Hello, I'm DXC-0  
I'm a network and free software enthusiast

<br/>

Didn't you know? I have several jobs.  

I am currently SOC Level 3 analyst for a big company, my job is to check that no one misses a critical security alert.  

I'm also Threat Intelligence Analyst part-time. I do intelligence on criminal groups and cyber threats.  

The rest of the time I take care of a Purple Team.

I've done a little of everything, Linux, Network, Scripting, Psychology and Criminal Sciences.  

Am I politicized? Let's just say I care about some questions, like privacy, you know?  

I think the internet has turned away from being a real trash can and the centralized system is an incredible aberration.  

Having more trouble right now with the Cyber and AI bullshit that we can see everywhere.
